WORK IN PROGRESS: currently only supports a few (outdated) icons from Heroicons

TO DO:
* add generators to gently scrape icon details from origin website to simplify maintenance
* add storybook support (this may be deferred)
* consider a second MIT or CreativeCommons icon set as an alternative to HeroIcons
* consider how to ensure the icon originators are okay with this
* add version field to sources so that its can be clear what version the original sources is at (for
instance, HeroIcons versions their icons -- we don't want to keep all those probably, but we do want
to note what version from HeroIcons was used)
  * this could help keep the icon sets updated
