# @!parse
#   # Often when using ViewComponent (in the client Rails app), a class will be defined
#   # named +ApplicationComponent+ that the developers will have their components inherit from
#   # instead of inheriting directly from {ViewComponent::Base}. +ApplicationComponent+ typically
#   # inherits from {ViewComponent::Base}, but allows additional customization for the
#   # application (in a similiar way that +ApplicationRecord+ or +ApplicationController+ does).
#   #
#   # For documentation purposes, this gem anticipates that +ApplicationComponent+ may exist and
#   # used as the base class (or an ancestor) for all icon components.
#   #
#   # If it exists, +ApplicationComponent+ is defined in the client Rails application.
#   # This documentation is a placeholder. See the client application for any additional
#   # information for this class.
#   class ::ApplicationComponent < ::ViewComponent::Base; end
